Setting Up and Deploying the API
To set up and deploy the API locally or on a server, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.

Install the required dependencies using npm install.

Set up the MongoDB connection by updating the connection string in the db.js file.

Start the API using npm start.

The API will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default. You can deploy it to a server of your choice following the server's deployment instructions.

Please ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or your server before running the API.
